  <thing id="bgArtist" name="Artist" description="Beauty drives you. It&apos;s really all that matters. Whether beauty takes the shape of a painting, a sonnet, a sculpture, or something else entirely doesn&apos;t matter. The fact that it&apos;s beautiful and, most importantly, you made it, does. You&apos;ve either apprenticed with another artist, perhaps in a studio with other would-be artists, or you have exceptional natural talent. Regardless, you likely specialize in a particular form of art. Now you just need to figure out how to make a living at it." compset="Background" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="bgHermit" name="Hermit" description="You left civilization for some reason to become a hermit. Perhaps you took a holy vow, perhaps you needed time alone to ponder an important question or remove yourself from a difficult situation, or perhaps you just don&apos;t care for people and are happy to be on your own.
